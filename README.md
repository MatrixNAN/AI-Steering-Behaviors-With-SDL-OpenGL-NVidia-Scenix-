# AI-Steering-Behaviors-With-SDL-OpenGL-NVidia-Scenix-
Artificial Intelligence Steering Behaviors With SDL C++ OpenGL Nvidia SceniX. Uses an Agent AI system with steering behaviors to have one object chase another to its destination over time. The target object that is being chased can be driven by game controller, or keyboard. In order to make it work you would need to put this folder into the samples directory in /usr/local/scenix/samples in Linux and compile from there. I have the entire project upon request but it is about 1 gigabytes in size.
Unzip the PhysX Engine code and the SDL code in order for this project to work.  This project was developed in Ubuntu Linux.
